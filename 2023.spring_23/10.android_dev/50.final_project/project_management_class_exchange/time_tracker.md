# Time tracker for Class Exchange Project

* 2 hours (May 10, 2023):
   - 45 min: Learning to create a project with Flutter CLI & other experiments
   - 1 h 15 min: Setup router scafold/template & home page (only do hello world). I spend way to much time on relearning the syntax I forgot a while ago.
