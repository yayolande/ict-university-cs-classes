## Deso

The app should include the need to use a cloud service in order to store user data remotely
The app should incluse the need to use SQLite on the local device in order to store data temporarily on the local device
Finally the app SHOULD NOT include a LOGIN PAGE
Any authentication need should use Google or Facebook authentication API which are already available on the device...
